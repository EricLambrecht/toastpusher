# Toast Pusher
_Toast Pusher_ displays [Pusher channel](https://pusher.com/channels) events as native toast messages on your device.

The app is (soon) available on Windows, macOS, iOS & Android.

## What does it do?
 
* Add/remove & toggle different Pusher channel configs (by setting key, cluster, channel & event name).
* Instantly display notifications as soon as the configured pusher channels receive events.
